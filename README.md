# Soundware
FUD remote sound recorder written in Python3

# How it works?

It records sound for 5 seconds (you can change that in line 9) and uploads it to FTP server and deletes file (to leave no trace)

# How to run it?

After you install requirements, all you need to do is edit file with your FTP credentials in line 19 and launch it with `python3 soundware.py` and that's it
